      Hi, I’m Gokul, an Applied Machine Learning graduate student at the University of Maryland. My work centers on building scalable, production-grade AI systems, combining machine learning, cloud-native architectures, and AI-driven scientific applications. Currently I am working with Prof Pratyush Tiwary on building good foundational models for RNAs!
